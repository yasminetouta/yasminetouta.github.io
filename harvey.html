        As I've been looking into all the ways that code can be used in the present, this interview helped me to see different ways one person can use code all in one life and build off that skill to create so much more. I especially liked the conversation around bringing Harveys personal identty into her work because as she said it was something that just happened naturally for her after being excluded from comparing herself to others who did not look like her. While I don't think I'll ever be an artist like Harvey, I'm extremely interested in learning how to bring my different identities into my web pages so that they can reflect more of me personally. I loved the idea of creating something as personal as love letters between two partners on the web through a website and thats definitly the kind of work I would love to try creating someday through code.
