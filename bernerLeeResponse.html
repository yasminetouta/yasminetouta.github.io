	<p>Tim Berner Lee’s article “Long live the web” talked about how many social networking pages are ruining 
the web by creating private pages on their websites that you can’t see unless you have access to that 
page. For Lee. This was a threat to the web because from the beginning of the webs history people have 
used the web to learn about whatever they wanted to know, and all the users of the web were learning 
from each other. Privatizing certain links or pages means that people can’t learn from everything on the 
web anymore and for Lee that is a problem.

While I understood what he meant by it being important for everyone to have access to everything on 
the web in order to learn in the most effective way, it's clear that the uses for the internet have majorly 
changed since the beginning of its existence. Now, people like to use aspects of the web and different 
apps on their phone to share their lives with people but in a private manner. I personally wouldn’t want 
to use parts of the web if it meant anyone could have access to the things I'm doing or looking through 
and I don’t care to be a part of anyone else's learning experience. I don’t think privacy on the web 
should be viewed as such a bad thing but more of a necessary thing now that there are millions of 
people who are actively using it. Having certain parts of the web be private and harder to access for 
everyone was just the natural next step in the webs evolution.</p>
